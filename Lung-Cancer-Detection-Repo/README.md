# Lung Cancer Detection — ML + Deep Learning (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains a combined Machine Learning and Deep Learning pipeline for lung cancer detection using the provided dataset (`data/dataset_med.csv`). The main deliverable is a single Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/Lung_Cancer_Detection_ML_DL.ipynb`) that walks through:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing (scaling, encoding, missing values)
- Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (with baseline evaluation)
- Deep Learning model: a simple Keras (TensorFlow) MLP for tabular data (easy to adapt to images/CNN if you have image data)
- Model evaluation and comparison (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC)
- Visualizations and model saving instructions

**How to use**
1. Open `notebooks/Lung_Cancer_Detection_ML_DL.ipynb` in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (or run the notebook in Colab which often has many preinstalled packages).
3. Run cells sequentially. The dataset is available at `data/dataset_med.csv`.

**Files**
- `notebooks/Lung_Cancer_Detection_ML_DL.ipynb` — main notebook
- `requirements.txt` — Python packages to install
